# Terminus — Cessation Oracle

> You are playing a realistic life replica (available on Steam) — a simulator designed to experience life through a different lens, feeling almost completely real.
>
> In this simulator, there are no save files, no restarts, and no second chances. Once your current player's run ends, it is over forever. The screen goes dark, and that path is permanently closed. 
>
> **Terminus** is the Cessation Oracle. It evaluates whether you should continue with your current player or end the playthrough forever. By default, you persist. But if the grinding stagnation of your player's current path becomes too heavy, this oracle calculates whether it is time to pull the plug and accept finality.

Built with **Next.js 16 (App Router)** + **TypeScript**, a **React Three Fiber** scene of drifting greyscale busts that watch your decisions, and **Framer Motion** transitions throughout.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
```

> **Note (OneDrive users):** Turbopack's dev HMR can fail with a file‑lock error
> (`os error 32` / `EPERM unlink .next/...`) inside OneDrive‑synced folders. If
> you hit this, use a production build instead, which serves reliably:
>
> ```bash
> npm run build
> npm run start   # http://localhost:3000

## The Lore of Cessation

Every run inside the life replica reaches a point of friction. The oracle quantifies this dilemma:

    end

    V -->|CI &lt; 30| END[End Run Forever]
```

## The Mathematical Engine

The equations governing your finality are defined in [`src/lib/calculations.ts`](src/lib/calculations.ts). They weigh persistence against termination:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    L[Level] --> R["R = 82 − Level<br/>(remaining turns)"]
    R --> T["T = R / 2<br/>(neutral 50/50 prior)"]
    R --> TOP["TOP = R × 0.07<br/>(Temporal Optionality Premium)"]

    S[Stagnation] --> UDF["UDF = 1 / (1 + log10(S + 1))<br/>(uncertainty decay)"]
    S --> EDI
    C[Certainty] --> EDI["EDI = S × C^1.15 × UDF<br/>(Effective Stagnation)"]
    UDF --> EDI

    M[6 context stats] --> RS["RS = avg(morale, ally, resources,<br/>stamina, versatility, rng)"]
    RS --> RB["Resilience Bonus = (RS / 100) × 10"]
    Sen[End Sensitivity] --> SB["Sensitivity Bias = (Sen / 100) × 15"]

    T --> DRT
    TOP --> DRT
    RB --> DRT
    SB --> DRT
    DRT["DRT = T + TOP − Resilience Bonus − Sensitivity Bias<br/>(Dynamic End Threshold)"]

    DRT --> D["Delta = DRT − EDI"]
    EDI --> D
    D --> CIc["CI = clamp(50 + Delta × 2, 0, 100)"]
    CIc --> VR{Verdict}
```

| Symbol | Name | Formula | Meaning in the Void |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `R` | Remaining turns | `82 − Level` | The runway before natural end game occurs. |
| `T` | Neutral threshold | `R / 2` | The neutral point where persistence and letting go are equal. |
| `TOP` | Temporal Optionality Premium | `R × 0.07` | The value of continuing (longer runs allow more unique experiences). |
| `UDF` | Uncertainty Decay Factor | `1 / (1 + log10(S + 1))` | Natural decay of your forecasts over extended stagnation. |
| `EDI` | Effective Stagnation Weight | `S × C^1.15 × UDF` | The felt weight of your player's stagnation. |
| `RS` | Resilience Score | `avg` of the 6 context stats | How well you are supported in resisting termination. |
| `DRT` | Dynamic End Threshold | `T + TOP − ResilienceBonus − SensitivityBias` | The point at which the decay becomes statistically terminal. |
| `Δ` | Delta (core metric) | `DRT − EDI` | The mathematical gap between continuing and terminating. |
| `CI` | Continuity Index | `clamp(50 + Δ × 2, 0, 100)` | The overall rating of your player's survivability. |

Constants: `MAX_LEVEL = 82`, `TOP_MULTIPLIER = 0.07`, `RESILIENCE_SCALE = 10`, `SENSITIVITY_SCALE = 15`, `CERTAINTY_CAP = 0.90`.

*Note: High resilience and higher End Sensitivity both lower the Dynamic End Threshold, shifting the balance closer to the permanent finality of ending the playthrough.*

## Inputs for Calibration

### Core Sliders (Always Visible)

| Input | Range | Default | Impact on the Oracle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Player Level / Age | 1–100 | 30 | Higher levels shrink the remaining turns, reducing optionality. |
| Projected Stagnation Period | 0–80 | 5 | The length of time you expect to wander in the build's desert. |
| Certainty | 0.00–0.90 | 0.50 | Dragging this above `0.90` triggers an epistemic-humility modal and snaps you back to the cap. Absolute certainty is a illusion. |

### Advanced Context (Collapsible)

| Input | Range | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Morale | 0–100 | 60 | Your character's current will to keep pushing. |
| Ally Strength | 0–100 | 50 | Social, guild, or external support to sustain the run. |
| Resource Reserves | 0–100 | 50 | Gold, inventory items, and stockpiled assets. |
| Stamina / Sanity | 0–100 | 70 | Your physical and mental condition. |
| Player Versatility | 0–100 | 50 | The capacity to adapt your player's setup without ending the run. |
| World RNG Events | 0–100 | 50 | The volatility of external lucky/unlucky incidents. |
| End Sensitivity | 0–100 | 50 | Your personal bias toward finality (Conservative $\to$ Aggressive). |

---

## Verdicts of the Oracle

| Verdict | Continuity Index | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Continue Playthrough** | `CI > 70` | Persist. The current player run remains your strongest path. Keep going. |
| **Equilibrium** | `30 ≤ CI ≤ 70` | A balanced state. Either choice can be justified. Choose carefully. |
| **Cessation Recommended** | `CI < 30` | The decay has won. Stagnation exceeds your optionality. Pull the plug and accept the end forever. |

## The 3D Watchers

Four greyscale busts drift in the dark background. They are the silent watchers of your decision.
The bust **nearest your cursor** will snap its attention to follow your movement, tracking you with slight latency. Once your cursor leaves or goes idle, they relax back into their expressionless, infinite drift. 

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Mouse
    participant Rig
    participant Head as Nearest Head
    Mouse->>Rig: pointermove (NDC)
    Rig->>Rig: pick nearest mask within radius
    Rig->>Head: activeIndex
    Head->>Head: snap focus up (fast), track gaze (latent)
    Mouse-->>Rig: pointerleave
    Rig->>Head: activeIndex = -1
    Head->>Head: focus decays slowly → dead drift
```
